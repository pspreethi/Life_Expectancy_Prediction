# Life_Expectancy_Prediction
## Project Overview

This notebook provides an analysis and modeling workflow to predict life expectancy using machine learning techniques. The process includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and predictive modeling.

## Key Features:

Dataset: Life Expectancy data sourced from WHO.
Techniques Used:
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values using interpolation and mean imputation.
EDA: Correlation analysis and feature selection.

## Predictive Modeling:
Multiple Linear Regression
Regression Trees
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)

## Highlights:

Linear Regression achieves MAE: 3.37, RMSE: 4.59, demonstrating strong predictive capability.
Regression Trees perform slightly better (MAE: 3.14, RMSE: 4.25) by capturing non-linear relationships.
SVM and MLP exhibit higher errors, indicating the need for optimization.

## Instructions:

Clone the repository and set up the environment as per the requirements.
Update the dataset file paths if needed.
Run the cells sequentially to preprocess the data, explore relationships, and evaluate models.

## Results:

The Regression Tree model is the most accurate for this dataset, making it suitable for scenarios with complex, non-linear relationships.
